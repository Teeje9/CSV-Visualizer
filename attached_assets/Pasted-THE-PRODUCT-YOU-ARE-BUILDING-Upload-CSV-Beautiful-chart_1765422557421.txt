THE PRODUCT YOU ARE BUILDING

Upload CSV → Beautiful charts + auto-generated insights.

This is literally what people want:
	•	They don’t know how to choose chart types
	•	They don’t know how to analyze data
	•	They don’t want to use Excel
	•	They want something simple + pretty

This tool gives:
	•	Automatic column detection
	•	Line/bar/scatter charts
	•	Summaries
	•	Trends
	•	Outliers
	•	Basic correlations
	•	“Interesting findings”

Super clean. Super usable.

🧩 THE MVP FEATURES (You only build these first)

1. CSV Upload
	•	Accept .csv, .tsv, .xlsx (xlsx optional for v2)
	•	Limit size (e.g., 3–5MB for v1)

2. Auto Column Detection

The backend classifies columns as:
	•	numeric
	•	categorical
	•	date
	•	boolean
	•	text (ignored unless insights detect something trivial)

3. Auto Chart Selection

Based on column types, generate:
	•	Line chart if (date + number)
	•	Bar chart if (category + number)
	•	Scatter plot if (number + number)
	•	Histogram if (single numeric column)

You can literally hardcode these rules.

4. Basic Insights Engine

For each numeric column:
	•	mean
	•	median
	•	min/max
	•	standard deviation
	•	total
	•	count

For pairs of numeric columns:
	•	correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)
	•	small blurb explaining the meaning (“Weak positive correlation between A and B”)

For date columns:
	•	trend detection (increasing? decreasing?)
	•	rate of change
	•	seasonal patterns (very simple)

5. UI to display results

Split screen:
	•	Left = insights
	•	Right = charts

Make it clean, minimalist, dark theme (your vibe).

🔥 THE SECRET SAUCE — THE INSIGHTS TEXT

This is where your product wins.

You generate short, human-like summaries such as:
	•	“Column X shows a steady upward trend over time.”
	•	“Column Y varies heavily — expect inconsistent patterns.”
	•	“Column Z has an unusually high peak around 2024-06.”
	•	“There’s a weak correlation between A and B (0.21).”
	•	“Users typically see most activity on weekends.”

People LOVE when the tool “talks back.”

You are basically building a mini data analyst.

🧱 THE TECH STACK (optimized for YOU)

Frontend
	•	React (since you know JS best)
	•	Tailwind for styles
	•	Recharts or Chart.js for charts
(Recharts is cleaner and easier for MVP)

Backend
	•	Node + Express
	•	Single endpoint for file upload
	•	Use multer for file handling
	•	Use papaparse or csv-parser to parse CSV

Insights Logic

All inside Node:
	•	numeric detection
	•	stats functions
	•	correlation calculations
	•	generate insights text from templates

You do NOT need AI for v1.
Just deterministic rules.

Database (Optional for MVP)

MVP doesn’t need a DB.

But if you want user accounts later:
	•	PostgreSQL (you already know it)
	•	Store: user, uploads, insight reports, charts
